Add a register method to @src\SharpClawLib\ChatClient.cs that allows you to register a callback ( `Action<string>` ) . Every time a skill is activated the callback should be called with the name of the skill that was activated.

Over in @src\SharpClawCli\Program.cs register a callback that writes the name of the activated skill to the console in light blue (make sure to restore color to previous color after writing skill).
