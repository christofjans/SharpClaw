The contstructor of ChatClient builds the effective system prompt as follows:

* system prompt
* skill metadata

If now want to add AGENTS.md to the mix. If in the root of the current directory there is a file called AGENTS.md, then its contents should be added to the system prompt before the skill metadata is appended. 

So the new order is:

* system prompt
* AGENTS.md (if it exists)
* skill metadata

Please modify the constructor of ChatClient to implement this change.
