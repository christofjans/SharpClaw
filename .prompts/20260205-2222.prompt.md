In @src\OpenBotCli\Program.cs, when I press ENTER to break out of the while loop, I get the message "Exiting... Saving memory." and then the program exits. This is as expected.


However, when I press CTRL+C to break out of the while loop, I get the message "Exiting... Saving memory." *TWICE* before the program exits. This is not expected. Memory should only be saved once upon exiting, regardless of how the exit is triggered.
