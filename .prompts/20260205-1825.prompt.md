In the file @src\OpenBotLib\ChatClient.cs there exists the method `ActivateSkill` .

If there is a prompt such that it seems it would be useful to call `ActivateSkill` to enhance the response, please modify the code to do so. 

The decision to call `ActivateSkill` should be based on the content of the prompt and whether activating a skill would provide a more accurate or relevant response.
It should use the LLM's capabilities to determine this. It should *NOT* be based on keyword matching or simple heuristics.
