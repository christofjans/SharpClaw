The constructor of the ChatClient class ( @src\OpenBotLib\ChatClient.cs ) accepts a `skillsDirectory` parameter.

I want the following modification:

* The contstrcutor does NOT accept a `skillsDirectory` parameter any more.
* Instead, the skills directory is always set to `.openbot/skills` inside the current directory.
* Finally, move the `LoadSkills` invocation to the `BuildSystemPrompt` method.
