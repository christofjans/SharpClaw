# Plan

## Problem statement
Implement skill support in `OpenBotLib.ChatClient` based on the Agent Skills spec, including skill discovery from a configurable directory, metadata exposure at startup, and on-demand loading of full `SKILL.md` content when a skill is activated. Current code only has `ChatClient` with prompt/streaming and tool support, and no skill-related types or files in the repo.

## Approach
Add a small skill model + loader in `OpenBotLib` that discovers skill directories, parses and validates `SKILL.md` frontmatter, and stores metadata plus body content. Extend `ChatClient` (or a new options/config class) to accept a skills root directory, inject skill metadata into the system prompt at initialization, and expose an activation method that loads the full skill instructions into the chat history. On invalid skill definitions, fail fast with a clear exception.

## Workplan
- [ ] Review `ChatClient` construction flow and decide where to inject skill metadata and activation hooks.
- [ ] Implement skill model and frontmatter parser/validator for `SKILL.md` (name/description required; optional fields as per spec).
- [ ] Implement skill discovery loader for a configurable skills directory and store metadata + body content.
- [ ] Extend `ChatClient` API/options to accept skills root, preload metadata into the system prompt, and expose a method to activate a skill by name (adds full `SKILL.md` content to history).
- [ ] Add/update minimal docs or usage examples reflecting the new skill support API.
- [ ] Run `dotnet build` to verify the library builds.

## Notes/Considerations
- Keep parsing self-contained unless adding a YAML dependency is preferred; frontmatter is bounded by `---` markers.
- Preserve existing behavior when no skills directory is provided (no changes to prompts).
