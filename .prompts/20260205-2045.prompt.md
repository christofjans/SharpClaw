The file @src\OpenBotLib\ChatClient.cs now supports skill activation. 

When a skill is activated, the details of that skill are added to the ChatClient's chat history (as a system message).

However, if the same skill is activated multiple times during a session, it should only be added to the chat history once.

Do you agree ? If not, please explain why.

If you do agree, please modify the code in src\OpenBotLib\ChatClient.cs to implement this functionality.
