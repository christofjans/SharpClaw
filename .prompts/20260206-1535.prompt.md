In @src\SharpClawCli\Program.cs, during inactivity it currently simply does:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Pulse triggered due to inactivity.");
```

Instead it should do the following:

* check if the file PULSE.md exists in the current directory
* if it does not exist continue as normal
* if it does exist, read the contents of the file . it should call a new method called PulseAsync(string prompt) on chatClient
* PulseAsync is very similar to PromptAsync, but it adds the prompt as a system message rather than a user message.
* the response from PulseAsync should not be printed to the console.
