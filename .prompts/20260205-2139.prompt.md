I want the following changes:

* ToolRunner (@src\OpenBotLib\ToolRunner.cs) ctor accepts an optional callback that is invoked right before invoking the tool.
* modify @src\OpenBotCli\Program.cs to pass a callback to ToolRunner that writes to the console - in red color -  "Invoking tool: {tool name}" before each tool invocation. It waits for the user to press Enter before proceeding. Make sure to switch back to the previous console color after writing the message.
