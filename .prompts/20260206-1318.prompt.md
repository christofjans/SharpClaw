The file @SharpClaw\src\SharpClawCli\Program.cs defines a variable `pulseMinutes`.

I want the system to print a message "Pulse triggered due to inactivity." if there has been no user input for the specified number of minutes in `pulseMinutes`.

In order to accomplish this, use the following pattern:

```csharp
var readTask = Task.Run(() => Console.ReadLine());
var delayTask = Task.Delay(pulseMinutes.Value * 60 * 1000);

var completed = await Task.WhenAny(readTask, delayTask);

// rest of code omitted for brevity
```

However, if `pulseMinutes` is null, the system should behave as it did before without any pulse functionality.
